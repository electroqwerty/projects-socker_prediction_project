# Soccer Match Outcome Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a prediction model for soccer match outcomes using various approaches. The focus is on aggregating team-specific features, assessing multicollinearity, and finalizing feature selection to build predictive models. Despite the challenges faced, this project provided valuable insights and highlighted areas for improvement.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Socker Data Analysis Main`: Central Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical inference, and model development.

## Relevant Technical Skills for This Sprint

1. Clean Code Principles (PEP8)
2. SQL (Sqlite)
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, or others)
6. Statistical Analysis (correlations and other relations between variables, and other EDA elements)
7. Linear and Logistic Regression (Scipy, statsmodels)
8. Statistical Inference (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests)
10. Proficient use of Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Tasks and Objectives
